    * Any file(s) that you want to save, version, track, and access after the execution should be saved as Valohai outputs.
    * Valohai will upload all files to your private cloud storage and version those files.
    * Each output will be availble under the executions outputs tab and in the project's data tab. From there you can download the file, or copy the link to that file.
    * When creating another execution you can pass in the ``datum://`` address of an output file, or use a cloud specific address (i.e. ``s3://``, ``gs://``, ``azure://``)
