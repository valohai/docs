Valohai can be deployed in your environment, either in the cloud or on-premise. The platform can also be deployed in multi-cloud setups and in hybrid setups with both cloud and on-premise resources.

When using Valohai:

* Your data stays in your environments (object storages, databases, and data warehouses).
* The machine learning jobs are performed on your own virtual machines.
* Models are deployed to your own object stores and registries.

.. admonition:: What is Valohai?
    :class: hint

    In short, Valohai allows you to spend less time on infrastructure management and manual experiment tracking and let your data scientists concentrate on building custom models.

Valohai components

Valohai comprises of two layers, the Application Layer and the Compute & Data Layer.

The Valohai application doesn't directly access your workers but instead writes requests and updates to the job queue machine, from where your own workers find jobs that are scheduled for them.

       * The **web application**
       * A **PostgreSQL database** for storing user and execution metadata information (who ran what, and when)
       * A **scaling service** responsible for managing virtual machine instances
       * A **deployment image builder** for building and publishing images for online-inference
       * The **API services** that enable you to:
          * Launch, view, and manage jobs, pipelines, and deployments
          * Access execution results, files, and metrics
          * Launch batch processing jobs
          * â€¦more :ref:`api`
     - 
       * A **virtual machine** that manages the machine learning job queue
       * **Object storage(s)** to store job logs, snapshots, and generated files (e.g. models, dataset snapshots)
       * **Autoscaled virtual machines** to run machine learning jobs
       * Other optional services, like:
          * Your existing **Kubernetes cluster**, to enable teams to deploy models for real-time inference
          * **Private Docker Registry**
          * Other **data sources** (databases, data warehouses, etc.)
          * A **Spark cluster**

Permissions and access
----------------------

Valohai will need a set of permissions in your cloud environment to autoscale your virtual machines and store logs, snapshots and generated files in an object storage.

First you provision the core Valohai services in your cloud and register your organization in Valohai. Then you can set up your projects and connect them with your Git repositories, object storages, and private Docker registries.

    See the installation pages for AWS, GCP, and Azure for detailed guides and installation templates.
