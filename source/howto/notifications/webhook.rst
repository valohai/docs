Webhooks
##########

Webhooks allow you to automatically trigger messages from Valohai to your application when an Valohai executions state changes.

For example, you could trigger a message from Valohai when:

* an execution completes or fails
* a task completes or fails
* a deployment completes or fails

In your application you could then receive this message from Valohai to for example post an update on a Slack channel, send an email, or start another internal process.

.. tip:: 

    You can also use tools like `IFTTT <https://ifttt.com/home>`_ and `Zapier <https://zapier.com/>`_ to automate your workflows with webhooks.
