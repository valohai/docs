Access a private Docker repository
####################################

Organizations can use private repositories from Docker Hub, AWS, GCP or Azure for Valohai executions.

.. admonition:: Prerequirements
    :class: attention

    This functionality is available only to projects that are owned by an organization or team. Personal projects don't have access to private repositories.


Create registry credentials for Valohai
------------------------------------------------


.. tab:: Docker Hub


    1. Log in to hub.docker.com.
    2. Click on your username in the top right corner and select **Account Settings**.
    3. Select **Security > New Access Token**.
    4. Add a description for your token. For example "Valohai access token".
    5. Copy the token that appears on the screen. Make sure you do this now: once you close this prompt, Docker will never show the token again.


    Read more at `Docker Hub: access tokens <https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/>`_

.. tab:: Azure

    Create and use `service principal credentials <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal>`_

.. tab:: AWS

    1. Login to your AWS Management Console
    2. Create a new User with *Programmatic access*
    3. Create a new policy `valohai-ecr-policy` with the below JSON
        * **Note:** Replace the placeholders with the right region, account ID and registry name.

        .. code:: json

            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Sid": "0",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": [
                            "ecr:DescribeImageScanFindings",
                            "ecr:GetLifecyclePolicyPreview",
                            "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                            "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                            "ecr:DescribeImages",
                            "ecr:DescribeRepositories",
                            "ecr:ListTagsForResource",
                            "ecr:ListImages",
                            "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                            "ecr:GetRepositoryPolicy",
                            "ecr:GetLifecyclePolicy"
                        ],
                        "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:repository/<REPOSITORY>"
                    },
                    {
                        "Sid": "1",
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
                        "Resource": "*"
                    }
                ]
            }


        ..
    4. Attach the new policy to the user and create the user.
    5. Make note of the IAM access key and secret to use in Valohai

.. tab:: GCP (Container Registry)

    Container Registry uses Cloud Storage buckets as their storage for your images.
    You control access to your images by granting appropriate Cloud Storage permissions to identities.

    1. Create a new service account under your Google Cloud project that contains the registry
    2. Add ``Service Account Token Creator`` role so it can create temporary tokens for itself
    3. Allow the service account to access the registry:
        * Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser (Cloud Storage listing)
        * Find and click the bucket that hosts your Container Registry images, it's in format ``<OPTIONAL_REGION>.artifacts.<PROJECT_ID>.appspot.com``
        * Click *Permissions*
        * Click *Add members*
        * Search for the service account using the full ID (the one that looks like an email)
        * Add role ``Storage Object Viewer`` if pulling or ``Storage Admin`` if pulling and pushing
        * Click *Save*
    4. Download the service account JSON to use in Valohai

.. tab:: GCP (Artifact Registry)

    1. Create a new service account under your Google Cloud project that contains the registry
    2. Add ``Service Account Token Creator`` role so it can create temporary tokens for itself
    3. Add ``Artifact Registry Reader``` role so it can download Docker images from your private repository
    4. Download the service account JSON to use in Valohai


Add credentials to Valohai
------------------------------------

* Login at `<https://app.valohai.com>`_
* Navigate to ``Hi, <name> (the top right menu) > Manage <organization>``
* Go to *Registries* under the organization controls
* Add a new entry
* Insert the match pattern in the format of ``<domain>/<owner-and-or-repository>/*`` e.g.
    * ``docker.io/myusername/*``
    * ``my-account-id.dkr.ecr.my-region.amazonaws.com/*``
    * ``gcr.io/my-project/*``
    * ``gcr.io/my-project/my-registry:*``
    * The exact form largely depends on your registry provider. Find how they report image names to learn the format.
* Choose your registry type and provide the access credentials generated in the first step
* Use the full name of the tagged container (e.g. ``docker.io/myusername/name:tag``) when defining the image in your ``valohai.yaml``
