Workload management
===================

We encapsulate machine learning workloads in entities called **executions**.
An execution is a similar concept as "a job" or "an experiment" in other systems,
but emphasis being that an execution is a smaller piece in a much larger data science process.

Simply put, an execution is one or more commands run on a remote server, check out
:doc:`Executions documentation page </topic-guides/core-concepts/executions>` to learn more about the high level
principles of executions.

Executions can be anything from data generation and preprocessing to model training and evaluation;
:doc:`What is Valohai? page </topic-guides/core-concepts/index>` explains different use-cases in more detail.

.. note::

    Your executions can be said to implement **a step** e.g. "preprocessing" or "training".

    Steps are defined in :doc:`the valohai.yaml configuration file </reference-guides/valohai-yaml/index>`. If your project doesn't yet have a ``valohai.yaml`` defined, your executions don't implement any step.

This section explains how to run and manage data science workloads on Valohai.
