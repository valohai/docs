Valohai 101
============================

The Valohai 101 Tutorials continue from where the :ref:`learning-paths-fundamentals` learning path left off.
Similarly to the learning path, the examples shown in this section are written in Python and use the ``valohai-utils`` helper library. 
Neither of these is a strict requirement for using Valohai and all the examples in the Tutorials can be replicated in other languages and also in Python without ``valohai-utils``.

If you want to get started for example with R, please take a look at our :ref:`example-projects-quick-start-r`. In case you need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. 
You can do that directly through the chat bubble at `app.valohai.com <http://app.valohai.com>`_ or over email: support@valohai.com
