    * This tutorial is a part of our :ref:`learning-paths-pipelines` series. Make sure you have completed the :ref:`learning-paths-fundamentals` learning path first. 
    * Even though not mandatory, we strongly recommend that you :ref:`repository` before using pipelines. Using Git is not a Valohai requirement but it will make your workflows more efficient.
