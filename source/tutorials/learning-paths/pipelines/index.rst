    * :ref:`repository` before using pipelines.
    * Basic knowledge on Valohai fundamentals.

This learning path is designed for those who have already finished the :ref:`learning-paths-fundamentals` and are familiar with the core concepts.  

Learning objectives:

- What is a pipeline
- Defining pipeline in the valohai.yaml
- Running pipelines
- Creating pipelines with ``valohai-utils``



In this tutorial we will be using simple Python scripts and sample data. At the end of this path you will know how to create pipelines in Valohai and run them both from the CLI (command line interface) and from the UI. 

This learning path uses the `the valohai-utils helper library for Python <valohai-utils/>`_ that you can ``import`` to your script.  It will also allow you to use the command line tools to generate the :ref:`yaml`.
