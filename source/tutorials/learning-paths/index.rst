Learning paths
##################


The learning paths are designed to guide you through your first steps in using Valohai and also to move towards more advanced topics, such as creating pipelines and tasks. In addition, they are useful for experienced users who want to revise their knowledge. 

The three main learning paths are:

* :ref:`learning-paths-fundamentals` 
* Pipelines
* Tasks (in-progress)
* Deployment (in-progress)

These learning paths are further divided into sections that start with a short introduction on the topic and the learning objectives. At the end of the path there is a set of knowledge check questions for the users to track their learning outcomes.

The language used in these tutorials is Python. If you plan to use some other language and/or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. You can do that directly through the chat bubble at `app.valohai.com <http://app.valohai.com>`_ or over email: support@valohai.com
